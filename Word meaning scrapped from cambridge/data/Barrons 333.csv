abate,become less in amount or intensity,"Something that abates becomes fewer or less intense. Your enthusiasm for skiing might abate after falling off a ski lift and getting a mouthful of snow.

Once the rains abated, my father’s garden thrived in the heat like an unleashed temper"
aberrant,markedly different from an accepted norm,"Use the adjective aberrant to describe unusual conduct. Sitting in a bathtub and singing show tunes all day long might be considered aberrant behavior.

For conduct that departs from the norm, aberrant is at hand to describe it if you want to set a formal, or even scientific tone to the discussion. You can put the accent on either the first syllable (AB-er-ent) or the second (uh-BER-ent); both pronunciations are acceptable. The Latin root aberrare means ""to go astray,"" from the prefix ab- ""off, away"" plus errare ""to wander."" Other descendants of errare in English, like error and errant, have that double -r- and also refer to something that's either not wanted or not expected."
abeyance,temporary cessation or suspension,"An abeyance is a temporary halt to something, with the emphasis on ""temporary."" It is usually used with the word ""in"" or ""into""; ""in abeyance"" suggests a state of waiting or holding.

The word abeyance has a legal ring to it, and for a good reason — appearing in English in the 16th century, it comes from the Anglo-French word abeiance, a legal term for waiting or hoping to receive property. Nowadays, the word is used in a similar way. Different legal rights, like property rights, can be held in abeyance until matters are resolved."
abscond,"run away, often taking something or somebody along","Abscond is to escape, often taking something along. As a kid, you may have absconded from your lemonade stand — with the coffee can of cash in hand, and your bewildered sister still filling cups for your customers.

Abscond is generally used to describe someone running from law or capture, and the word abscond has been in use since the early sixteenth century — running away and hiding being nothing new. Dogs who get off the leash and dart into the woods are not necessarily absconding; they are simply making a break for it. On the other hand, the Ponzi schemer who went to live in the South of France with his client's money? He absconded"
abstemious,marked by temperance in indulgence,"Reserve abstemious for someone who exercises restraint, especially with regard to alcohol. A rock musician may sing about enjoying wine and women, but in his private life he may be abstemious.

You might get the idea that abstemious is a relative of abstain with a change of consonant, but in fact the two words only share the abs- prefix, meaning ""away."" The -temious bit in this adjective is from Latin temetum, ""intoxicating drink,"" so it came to refer to someone who keeps alcohol (or other temptations) at arm's length. This word has the vowels a, e, i, o and u in alphabetical order; the adverb abstemiously adds the y!"
admonish,scold or reprimand; take to task,"To admonish is to scold. If you want to show someone you're not happy with his behavior, admonish him.

Coming to English through Old French from the Latin admonere ""to advise, remind,"" admonish is always used with an eye on improving someone's behavior. The exact meaning of this formal verb varies in intensity depending generally on who is being corrected. If a child or subordinate is being admonished, it means ""scold"" or ""rebuke"" whereas if someone admonishes a person with equal standing, warn or advise are closer synonyms."
adulterate,make impure by adding a foreign or inferior substance,"If you adulterate something, you mess it up. You may not want to adulterate the beauty of freshly fallen snow by shoveling it, but how else are you going to get to work?

The verb adulterate comes from the Latin word adulterare, which means “to falsify,” or “to corrupt.” Whenever something original, pure, fresh, or wholesome is marred, polluted, defaced, or otherwise made inferior, it has been adulterated. Your grandfather may, for instance, believe that bartenders adulterate the name “Martini” by applying it to combinations of vodka, chocolate or anything other than a mixture of five parts gin to one part dry vermouth, on the rocks, with a twist."
aesthetic,characterized by an appreciation of beauty or good taste,"The adjective aesthetic comes in handy when the subject at hand is beauty or the arts. A velvet painting of dogs playing poker might have minimal aesthetic appeal.

Aesthetic, from a Greek word meaning ""perception,"" comes to us from German philosophers who used it for a theory of the beautiful. From this technical sense, it soon came to refer to good taste and to artistry in general; if something has ""aesthetic value,"" it has value as a work of art (even if nobody will pay much for it). It does not, however, refer to the objects themselves; do not talk about an ""aesthetic painting."""
aggregate,a sum total of many heterogeneous things taken together,"To aggregate is to collect many units into one. If you're writing a novel, you might create a character who is an aggregate of five or six real people.

Aggregate comes from the Latin verb aggregare, which means to add to. As a verb it means to collect into a mass or whole. You can also use it as an adjective, as in your aggregate sales for February, March and April. It can also be a noun. The mountain of foam in bubble bath is an aggregate of small bubbles. If you plan to work in economics or business, expect to see the word aggregate quite a lot."
alacrity,liveliness and eagerness,"Someone with alacrity shows cheerful willingness and eager behavior, like a kid whose mother has told him he can buy anything in a candy store.

While the noun alacrity normally refers to someone's peppy behavior, it can also describe a certain mood or tempo of a musical composition, indicating how the music should be played. Alacrity comes from the Latin alacritas, and the Italian musical term allegro is a near relation."

Sage,someone who has recently become involved in an activity and is still learning about it,"A neophyte is someone who's brand new at something. You're a neophyte the first time you pick up a guitar and start learning to play.

Neo- means new, and -phyte is from the Greek phuton, ""plant"" — like a baby plant, a neophyte is someone who is new to an activity. In Greek, neophytos (literally ""newly planted"") was used to refer to a new church convert. A political neophyte is someone who is newly elected and comes to Washington D.C. not understanding how the game of politics is played. A Frisbee neophyte is someone who has just thrown the disc for the first time."
